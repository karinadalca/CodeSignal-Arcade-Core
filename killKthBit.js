// Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
// In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

// You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.

function killKthBit(n, k) {
  return parseInt((n.toString(2).substring(0,n.toString(2).length-k)+'0'+n.toString(2).substring(n.toString(2).length-k+1,n.length)),2);
