// Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighboring, too).

// Example

// For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
// circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.
